# Hello-World

Hello everyone, I'm The Fordicator

  I'm fairly new to software development, and I figured I get with the times and join GitHub. For now I plan on using this as a way to learn more by looking at others' projects. Hopefully one day I will have projects of my own and assist with the development of others. For now though, I'm a noob. My dream is to develop games for a living but I'll settle with software development in genereal. I look forward to working with and learning from the community here.
